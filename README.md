This repository contains two JavaScript files, `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js`, that illustrate a common error in JavaScript programming: the misuse of the equality operator.  The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect use of loose equality (==), which can lead to unexpected results due to type coercion. The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the correct use of strict equality (===), which avoids type coercion and produces more predictable results.  This is a common source of bugs in JavaScript, particularly for developers transitioning from other programming languages.
